How to run program:
./chain [-h] [-p nprocs] [-c nchars] [-s sleeptime] [-i niters] < textfile

nprocs: Number of processes [default 4]
nchars: Number of characters read into the buffer [default 80]
sleeptime: Time to sleep in each iteration [default 3s]
niters Numbner: of iterations in the loop
textfile: File containing text to be read through stdin

Description: Program forks processes and demonstrates what happens when a parent process finishes before the child

Observations:
step 2:
when ran with input 4, the process ID's increment by one from a starting ID to 4 nubers after that
So the ID's look like: 100,101,102,103

Step 3:
Same as step two the process ID's values increment up to the inputed number. 
The number of adopted processes averages around 60% to 80% at 50 processes inputted.
The number of processes picked up by init varies. For some runs it may only be 20%.
There is a large spread in the number of processes being adopted.

Step 4:
The spread on the number of processes being adopted is lower.
Now it seems to be a steady 40% to 50% of processes are adopted if 50 processes are inputted

*It is harder to see a difference between steps 3 and 4 at a lower number of processes but depending on the execution, step 4 has less adoptions

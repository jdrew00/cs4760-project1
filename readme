How to run program:
./chain [-h] [-p nprocs] [-c nchars] [-s sleeptime] [-i niters] < textfile

nprocs: Number of processes [default 4]
nchars: Number of characters read into the buffer [default 80]
sleeptime: Time to sleep in each iteration [default 3s]
niters Numbner: of iterations in the loop
textfile: File containing text to be read through stdin

Description: Program forks processes and demonstrates what happens when a parent process finishes before the child

Observations:
step 2:
when ran with input 4, the process ID's increment by one from a starting ID to 4 nubers after that
So the ID's look like: 100,101,102,103

Step 3:
Same as step two the process ID's values increment up to the inputed number. 
The number of adopted processes averages around 60% to 80% at 50 processes inputted.
The number of processes picked up by init varies. For some runs it may only be 20%.
There is a large spread in the number of processes being adopted.

Step 4:
The spread on the number of processes being adopted is lower.
Now it seems to be a steady 40% to 50% of processes are adopted if 50 processes are inputted
some runs it is only 30% of processes being adopted

*It is harder to see a difference between steps 3 and 4 at a lower number of processes but depending on the execution, step 4 has less adoptions
*Increasing the number of processes also seems to increase the percent of processes being adopted

Step 5:
Introducing more loop iterations and having the program sleep has greatly reduced the number of processed being adopted.
When the program is ran with 4 second sleep and 5 loop iterations only the last process is adopted.
That is one out of 20 compared to 10-12 proccesses that we saw in earlier steps
* it is difficult to see how modifying the sleep and iterations affect this since there is two variables

Step 6:
Adding the wait function messes up the iterations. Before all of loop one would print then the next iteration would print.
Now they are mixed together. It looks like you can execute 100 processes still but that might just be on my environment 
There aren't any processes adopted by init from what I've seen.
